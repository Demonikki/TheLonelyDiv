# TheLonelyDiv

This project creates a 2D model of a Galaxy S7 using only CSS. The main constraint is that the markup code contains only 1 div element.
Therefore this project emphasises code re-use and clever structuring of the CSS code to fit in as many elements as possible under one div.

# Installation
Just download galaxy.html and galaxystyle.css into the same folder and open galaxy.html in your browser.



# Known Issues

### All browsers
Volume buttons use solid white strips to cut the buttons to size - therefore only works on white background.
### Microsoft Edge
Home button is not visible when zooming in past 150%. This bug is browser-specific.
### Google Chrome
Border radius for Home button does not get applied.
